# Magikarp Ground Mission

## Problem Description

Do you know how to move between directories and read files in the shell? Start the container, `ssh` to it, and then `ls` once connected to begin. Login via `ssh` as `ctf-player` with the password, `ee388b88`

## Hints

1. Finding a cheatsheet for bash would be really helpful!

## Solution

In order to get the address and port to ssh into, you need to first launch the instance if it's not already started. After logging in, we check the current directory's contents.

```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
1of3.flag.txt  instructions-to-2of3.txt
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat 1of3.flag.txt
picoCTF{xxsh_
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat instructions-to-2of3.txt
Next, go to the root of all things, more succinctly `/`
```

This wants us to navigate to the root directory. We do so and get the second part of the flag.

```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cd /
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
2of3.flag.txt  boot  etc   instructions-to-3of3.txt  lib64  mnt  proc  run   srv  tmp  var
bin            dev   home  lib                       media  opt  root  sbin  sys  usr
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat 2of3.flag.txt
0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat instructions-to-3of3.txt
Lastly, ctf-player, go home... more succinctly `~`
```

Similarly, this wants us to navigate to the home directory, which gets us the last part of the flag.

```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cd ~
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
3of3.flag.txt  drop-in
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat 3of3.flag.txt
3ca613a1}
```

## Flag

picoCTF{xxsh_0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_3ca613a1}
