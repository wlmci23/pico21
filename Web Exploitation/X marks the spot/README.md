# X marks the spot

## Description

Another login you have to bypass. Maybe you can find an injection that works? http://mercury.picoctf.net:20297/

## Hints

1. XPATH

## Solution

After digging around, we find that putting `' or ''='` for both username and password displays `You're on the right path.`.

This likely means that a matching result was found from the query. This would mean that we are to perform a blind boolean-based XPATH injection.

Few queries were used to determine the schema.

For example, from `' or count(//user)=3 or 'a'='`, we can see that there are three users.

With the following injection, we can guess one character at a time for a specific user.

```
' or starts-with(//user[<1-indexed user ID>]/pass, '<insert guess here>') or 'a'='
```

The script to guess the password is included in [script.py](./script.py).

Note: The password to the user with ID 3 is the flag.
