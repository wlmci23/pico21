# It's My Birthday

## Solution

In this challenge we must find 2 pdf files that are different but produce the same MD5 hash. 

PHP has a vulnerability where if a hash beginning with 0e is compared to another one that starts with 0e, they are evaluated to be the same, even though they are different.

We can exploit this by using any string that yields a hash with 0e. 

A quick search gives us: 
```
s878926199a
s155964671a
```
Now if we put each string into a pdf file, and then submit it, we'll get our birthday invitation.
