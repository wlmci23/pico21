# Web Gauntlet 3

## Description

Last time, I promise! Only 25 characters this time. Log in as admin Site: http://mercury.picoctf.net:24143/ Filter: http://mercury.picoctf.net:24143/filter.php

## Hints

1. Each filter is separated by a space. Spaces are not filtered.
2. There is only 1 round this time, when you beat it the flag will be in filter.php.
3. sqlite

## Solution

Our winning payload was:

Username: `'||max('admi'||'n',`
Password: `)||'`

Similar to Web Guantlet 2, this payload works by using the MAX() function in Sqlite3 to ignore the password portion of the SQL query.
We determined that there was nowhere else to shorten our query except for the COALESCE() function itself, so MAX() function was used to ignore the second string.
