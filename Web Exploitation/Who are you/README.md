## Solution

This is a simple HTTP request spoofing challenge, where we must modify the request headers and get the desired responses. 

When we first visit the page, we get a "official picobrowser" message.

Then we modify our User-Agent header: 
```
User-Agent: picobrowser
```
Then we get a message: "I don't trust users visiting from another site.". We then modify the `referer` header: 
```
Referer: mercury.picoctf.net:36622
```

Now we get the gist of it, it asks us to time travel back to 2018. 
So I'll just set my request Date header to a random 2018 date. 
```
Date: Thu, 20 Dec 2018 05:00:00 GMT
```
For the next one, we set a Do Not Track header and put the value to 1
```
DNT: 1
```
For the last step, it asks us to visit from Sweden????
Unles you can teleport to Sweden for the contest, you basically have no way for originating the request from there.
Fortunately, we can set the `X-Forwarded-For` header to a random Swedish IP. In this case I used `31.192.231.168`
```
X-Forwarded-For: 31.192.231.168
```
We'll also need to set our language to Swedish, so: 
```
Accept-Language: sv-SE
```

Now we get our flag, which is
```
picoCTF{http_h34d3rs_v3ry_c0Ol_much_w0w_0da16bb2}
```
