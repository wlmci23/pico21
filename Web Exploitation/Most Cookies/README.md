# Most Cookies

## Solution

We are given a server.py file that issues a flask cookie. It seems like we must forge a cookie to be admin so that we can get the flag. 

The cookie I got was: 
```
eyJ2ZXJ5X2F1dGgiOiJjaG9jb2xhdGUgY2hpcCJ9.YG2yQA.AeMvtReNYwVkWl3T4v2DccF5BJw
```
According to flask, the first part is a base64 encoded string of json data, second one is the timestamp, and the third is the hash. 

Decoding the JSON gives us
```
{"very_auth":"blank"}
```
We must change this to admin to receive the flag. 

However directly tampering with the cookie won't work, as the hash would be incorrect. We can brute force each possible secret key (since the list was given inside server.py)

After some brute forcing we find the secret key to be `chocolate chip`

Then we can forge our cookie

```
eyJ2ZXJ5X2F1dGgiOiJhZG1pbiJ9.YG2x-Q.vPrJkhzPZiO1IIfApoE6S983Ql0
```

In your browser, replace the cookie inside the devtools tab and go the the /display page. Then we'll get our flag: 

```
picoCTF{pwn_4ll_th3_cook1E5_dbfe90bf}
```
